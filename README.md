# Exploration A
A game based on the Navidson Record

# Note
This game is in **very** early development, but if you want to check out the progress I have so far, check the [releases](https://github.com/jamesw98/exploration_a/releases) page. I'll upload there fairly often

# Controls
**wasd/arrow keys** - move  
**shift** - dash (only if the green dot is above your head)  
**space** - sneak  
**e** - interact
